// Let's get some practice defining constants. In index.js, please define the following two variables:
// Define a constant called boilingPointC and set it to 100. 
// Define a second constant called boilingPointF and set it to 212. 
// That's it!
// (technically, I can't test that you are using const instead of let...so you're on the honor system here! DO THE RIGHT THING AND USE const!

// YOU CODE GOES HERE:
const boilingPointC = 100;
const boilingPointF = 212;
