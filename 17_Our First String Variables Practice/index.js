// Please define the following string variables (you can use either let or const):
// bestColor should be set to the string purple (the best color on planet earth, as we all know);
// quote should be set to the string You had me at "hello" - be careful about quotation marks, we want double quotes inside the string.

// Your code goes in here:
let bestColor = "purple"
let quote = 'You had me at "hello"'
