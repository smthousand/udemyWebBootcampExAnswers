// It's time to practice creating your own object literal.  Please define a new variable called product.  It should be an object literal with the following properties:
// name - set to the string "Gummy Bears"
// inStock - set to the boolean true
// price  - set to the number 1.99
// flavors - set to an array of at least three strings like ["grape", "apple", "cherry"]

// Your code goes in here:
const product = {
    name: "Gummy Bears",
    inStock: true,
    price: 1.99,
    flavors: ["grapes", "apple", "cherry"]
};
